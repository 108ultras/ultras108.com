<p>
    When the Wanderers play at home again <br />
    Hurrah, hurrah !
</p>

<p>
    We'll give them a noisy welcome then <br />
    Hurrah, hurrah !
</p>

<p>
    The men will cheer and the boys will shout <br />
    And the ladies they will all turn out
</p>

<p>
    And we'll all cheer when the Wanderers play at home
</p>
