<p>
    Oh we'll be alright <br />
    When the wind is in our sails.
</p>

<p>
    Oh we'll be alright <br />
    When the wind is in our sails, <br />
    And we'll all hang on behind.
</p>

<p>
    And we'll Roll the old, <br />
    Wanderers along, <br />
    And we'll Roll the old, <br />
    Wanderers along.
</p>

<p>
    And we'll Roll the old, <br />
    Wanderers along, <br />
    And we'll all hang on behind.
