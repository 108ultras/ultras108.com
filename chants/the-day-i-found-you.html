<p>
    The day I found you Wanderers, <br />
    I fell in love with you. <br />
    My heart was beating loudly, <br />
    And that is how I knew.
</p>

<p>
    The days have come and gone, <br />
    But still I return here.<br />
    For I support you Wanderers,<br />
    And I follow without fear !
</p>

<p>
    Allez, allez, allez ! <br />
    Allez, allez, allez ! <br />
    Allez, allez, allez ! <br />
    Allez, allez, allez ! 
</p>
